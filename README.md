##Basics About Git
Git is used for  managing & tracking changes in files or codes. When we work on project there is a chance of modification occurring so Git can be used to save the changes at each stage. A version control system is used to save the versions of the same file or code. So that even if there was an error in the current code you can access the prior code or file. by using git you can ensure that nothing gets lost.
###Setting up Git
downloaded GitHub desktop for using git and signed in to GitHub account. also downloaded git. Some of the Basic Git commands are:
git init: This command is used to create a new repository in the current directory
git clone <repository-url>: To copy existing remote repository to local machine. so you can work on it offline.
git add: stage changes for commit.
git commit: Save changes with a message showing what you changed.
git push: Send changes from local repository to remote repository.
git pull: Download changes from remote repository to local repository. this keeps you up to date with the changes someone else makes.
git branch: used to create new branch. branches allows u to work on different versions of the projrct simultaneously.
git merge: used to combine branches. is used to add feature branches into main branch.
git checkout: To switch between branches. also can be used to restore specific versions.
