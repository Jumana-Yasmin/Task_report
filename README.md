 # Day 6, Mini-Project: Basic Data Science API
 1. __Project Overview__: Develop a Flask API that loads a dataset (e.g.,
 movies, books, or any other dataset), allows CRUD operations on
 the data, and provides basic analysis (like average rating).
 2. Steps to Implement:
 ○ Use Git to create a new repository and manage your project
 code.
 ○ Set up Flask routes to perform CRUD on the dataset.
 ○ Implement endpoints for basic data analysis (e.g., average,
 count, filter by condition).
 ○ Document the API endpoints in a README file.
 3. Recommended resources: Look up similar projects or Flask
 tutorials that integrate data science basics   


. created a repository named mini project and opened vs code and created a file named project.py and books.csv.
. imported flsk,request, and jsonify.
. created a Dataset named books.csv and added details about 10 books with their id,title, author genre and ratings
. performed crud operations on the dataset. create routes to find out the average rating, total count and filtered books by their genre.
